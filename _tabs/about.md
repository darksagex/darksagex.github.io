Hi, I’m DarkSageX, an aspiring ethical hacker and security researcher. My interests lie in penetration testing, reverse engineering, exploit development, and low-level programming. I’m currently learning C, Python, Assembly, and OSINT, while exploring how systems work at a deeper level.
What I Share Here

- Security research, CTF write-ups, and hacking techniques
- Reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and malware analysis
- Low-level programming with C, Python, and Assembly
- Hands-on projects and technical deep dives

This website is a place to document my journey, share what I learn, and contribute to the cybersecurity community. If you share the same passion for hacking and security, feel free to connect.
